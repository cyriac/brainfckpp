This is an old unmaintained project migrated from sourceforge.

====================================================
	 Brainfuck++ aka bfpp interpreter
====================================================
Brainfuck interpreter with the proposed syntax from 

www.jitunleashed.com/bf/index.html


The ip syntax is to place the ip and port with the following syntax in the cells
ip:port followed by null
ie; 127.0.0.1:1221 will be represented as
49 50 55 46 48 46 48 46 49 58 49 50 50 49 0

We have introduced a few other instructions for a little more flexibility
1. D
2. =

If in debug mode D( applied by the command line option -d) it prints
the current pointer number, next 5 instructions, and asks the user for
the range for memory dump and edit. If not in debug mode it skips the
debug instruction.

For multiline commenting we have added an = sign. anything b/w the = pairs,
is considered comment.This was added to include the default
instructions for commenting. Old commenting method is still retained.

This interpreter has been tested working on GNU/Linux 
and Microsoft Windows.

====================================================
		Using the interpreter
====================================================

After Installation you are straight away ready to run the interpreter.
Write a program "test.b", Run it as:

	$bfpp.rb test.b

In debug mode
	$bfpp.rb -d test.b

====================================================
		Problems That need to be fixed
====================================================
1. loop gets stuck at a 0 value in the 0th cell (traditional Bf code problems)
2. odd number of = doesn't help out.
3. The extra_key_junk has a problem with previous statemnts of no stdout.
